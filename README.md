Smart Agro is a cross platform ecommerce platform and recommendation system for farmers   .
It is developed using Python(ML-Google Colab),Java(Android),Django-oscar framework (Ecommerce Website)and is available as a webapp,native android,ios apps!
  
The python ML module integrates the data such  as temperature, rainfall, soil attributes obtained from multiple repositories like IMD,agmarknet,data.gov.in,apnikheti etc.among other  government repositories. By applying MLR (Multiple Linear Regression), most suitable crops in a particular area for a particular season are recommended to the seller. This provides a farmer with variety of options of crops that can be cultivated. It uses Apriori algorithm to perform Market Basket Analysis and provides cross selling recommendations to sellers  based on customer buying pattern of the crops on our ecommerce website to further increase profitability.

The website provides a broker-free ecommerce platform to the farmers, to get the best price for their agricultural produce. It allows citizens, farmers to sell or to buy agricultural entities needed on a day-to-day basis directly from farmers or vendors.
 
The android app integrates the ML models and ecommerce site and additional provides information.
The project aims to reduce farmer suicides by showing some motivational videos as well as success stories and ideas used by peer farmers to increase profitability. The application aims to provide 
farmers with the links to various central and state government schemes and websites.  The project acts as a complete guide containing different varieties of crops, suitable weather and soil conditions for the crops, production methods, fertilizers, possible diseases along with treatment and yield information thereby meeting most of the farmerâ€™s requirements.
