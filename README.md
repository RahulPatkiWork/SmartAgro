# SmartAgro

*Introduction*:

Smart Agro is a cross platform system for :
#Ecommerce (buying and selling of crops),
#Prediction of optimal crop prices in future,
#Recommendation systems for farmers.

*Languages:*
The project uses: python,java,css,js,html etc.Sqlite3 and Postgre have been used for database.
It is mainly developed using Python(ML-Google Colab),Java(Android),Django-oscar framework(Ecommerce Website) and is available as a webapp,native android app & ios app!

*Details*
The python based ML modules perform the following tasks:
#Future Crop price prediction is performed on dataset provided by government(data.gov.in) by applying SVR to perform time series crop price predictions

#Apriori algorithm is used to perform Market Basket Analysis and provides cross selling recommendations to sellers  based on customer buying pattern of the crops on our ecommerce website to further increase profitability.

#The website provides a broker-free ecommerce platform to the farmers, to get the best price for their agricultural produce. It allows citizens, farmers to sell or to buy agricultural entities needed on a day-to-day basis directly from farmers or vendors.

#Data such  as temperature, rainfall, soil attributes obtained from multiple repositories like IMD,agmarknet,data.gov.in,apnikheti etc.among other  government repositories are used to determine most suitable crops in a particular area for a particular season by applying MLR (Multiple Linear Regression),these crops are recommended to the seller.

The java part is used to make the android app which performs following tasks:
#The android app integrates the ML models and ecommerce site and additional provides information.

#The app provides some motivational videos as well as success stories and ideas used by peer farmers to increase profitability.

#The application provides farmers with the links to various central and state government schemes and websites.Thus the project acts as a complete guide containing different varieties of crops, suitable weather and soil conditions for the crops, production methods, fertilizers, possible diseases along with treatment and yield information thereby meeting most of the farmerâ€™s requirements.
